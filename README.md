# SamplingBalancedForests
This work extends the conjecture from "Sampling Balanced Forests of Grids in Polynomial Time," that states a polynomial fraction of all uniform spanning trees (USTs) are splittable into $k$ balanced partitions on grid graphs to real-world political districting plans. We investigate whether similar structural properties hold for the planar dual graphs of U.S. counties and tracts. Using \textbf{Wilsonâ€™s algorithm}, we generate uniform random spanning trees and then apply \textbf{Breadth-First Search (BFS)} to assess whether the USTs can be partitioned. Our empirical findings suggest that real-world districting plans can be split into 2-balanced, connected partitions in a fraction of polynomial time. This result highlights the potential for scalable redistricting algorithms that preserve connectivity and balance while improving computational efficiency. By bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical applications, this work contributes to the broader computational redistricting community, providing empirically driven results that advance efficient, unbiased partitioning techniques for electoral districting.
